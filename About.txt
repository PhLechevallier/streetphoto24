Welcome to StreetPhoto24.com,

In this site, you will see <strong>a selection of pictures taken on the fly in cities</strong>, the cities where I live and where I travel. You will see, most of the pictures have been taken in the Netherlands, especially in Almere. There are also albums about French cities and a few ones outside Europe. 

Why do I like to take street photography’s? Simply because <strong>the cities are continually changing and there is always something to discover in the streets and on the public places</strong>. Almost all photographs have been made with a Sony Alpha 65 camera and with a 50mm lens. 

Why to publish my pictures on internet? The reasons are that I like to share them and that <strong>I will be happy to get feedback from you </strong>and the other viewers. Although I have been photographing for more than 12 years, I still have to improve a lot and your comments will be welcome.

Visit the albums by clicking cities that your prefer, and enjoy.

Thanks,

Philippe Lechevallier
